Page Frame Allocation

current idea: maintain red-black tree of ranges of free page frames. I *think*
this is what is used in openBSD and described in the presentation on pmemrange I
found, but even if it isn't itll still hopefully work. This is ideal for cases
where we need large blocks of contiguous page frames but for what I'm doing
thats likely actually fairly rare. still, it will hopefully work well for the
real common case of allocating 1 page at a time also.

other ideas: I should read some more stuff to see how other kernels do it, maybe
including some other hobby kernels since my use case isnt the same as linux or a
BSD

Documentation

I need to start annotating stuff with doxygen and potentially set up the docs to
auto-deploy to github pages.
